# Virtual assistant using Simsimi 
API-PythonThis is a project that will use the simsimi API to create a chatterbot to chat, which can be used for testing purposes.

## Configuring the bot to run on the terminal
- With everything installed, we will clone the repository like this:
  $ git clone https://github.com/ThuyLinh110/ThuyLinh110.github.io/tree/master/AI/Simsimi-chatbot
- pip install requirements.txt

## Boot process
- Start conversation, run: python main.py
- Say something by your micro to chat with Simsimi
- If it's been too long the micro doesn't hear from you, press ENTER to speak again
- Stop conversatin, say: "Dừng lại"
